About pull requests

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in 
a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened,
 you can discuss and review the potential changes with
 collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are 
merged into the base branch.

Creating a pull request

Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository.
 These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that 
the default branch only contains finished and approved work.
